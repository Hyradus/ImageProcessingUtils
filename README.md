- Crop images to 1:1 aspect ratio from the center of the image

- Convert from JP2 format to Geotiff, jpg/png + world file

## Usage
These tools can be used in a conda environment or in docker container.
For Conda environment, just install the required packages, activate the env, otherwise build the container using the provided Dockerfile. In both cases do as follows:
** Command Line Interface **
- Create provided environment or install required packages
- Just execute the script and interactively insert all parameters.
** Jupyter Notebook **
- Create provided environment or install required packages
- Run the notebook and change the config dictionary or just run and pass configs interactively
If using CLI execute the script passing at least --PATH argument

The script will automatically create subfolders containing the results.
